## Reading

The resources below are great if you are hoping to learn more about Git, whether you are coming from nothing or are just hoping to level up your git skills.

### [Atlassian Tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git)

Atlassian's product **Bitbucket** is one of the more popular Git hosting services available. In addition to having a great product, they have a lot of documentation available.

The Atlassian tutorial on git is one of the best for beginners. It goes over not only the basics of how to use git, but also answers important questions like "What is version control?" and "Why git?".

It is a great starting point if you are a git beginner.

### [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

**Pro Git** is a book written by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub and is generously [licensed to be free](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/). It is linked to by the official Git website.

In addition to going over the various git commands, **Pro Git** covers other import topics, such as workflows for developers sharing a repository (a necessary skill for a developer working on a team) and how to configure git for your particular needs.

Whereas the Atlassian tutorial above is a great resource for learning the basics, **Pro Git** might be a better fit if you are hoping to get more in depth. Both resources begin with the basics, but **Pro Git** is much more expansive.

## Tips & Tricks

These resources are good to have on hand in case you find yourself backed into a git corner and need help getting out.

### [Git Flight Rules](https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules/blob/master/README.md)

> Flight Rules are the hard-earned body of knowledge recorded in manuals that list, step-by-step, what to do if X occurs, and why. Essentially, they are extremely detailed, scenario-specific standard operating procedures.
