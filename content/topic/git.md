### Official Documentation

[Read Now &raquo;](https://git-scm.com/docs/)

The official documentation for git is both well organized and well written. Each command has a description, set of commands, examples, and more. While jumping straight into the docs might be a bit intimidating for your beginner git user, it is a great resource for anybody who uses git.

### Atlassian Tutorial

The Atlassian tutorial on git is one of the best for beginners. It goes over not only the basics of how to use git, but also answers important questions like "What is version control?" and "Why git?".

It is a great starting point if you are a git beginner.

## Leveling Up

### Pro Git

[Read Now &raquo;](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

**Pro Git** is a book written by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub and is generously [licensed to be free](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/). It is linked to by the official Git website.

In addition to going over the various git commands, **Pro Git** covers other import topics, such as workflows for developers sharing a repository (a necessary skill for a developer working on a team) and how to configure git for your particular needs.

Whereas the Atlassian tutorial above is a great resource for learning the basics, **Pro Git** might be a better fit if you are hoping to get more in depth. Both resources begin with the basics, but **Pro Git** is much more expansive.

### Git Flight Rules

[Read Now &raquo;](https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules/blob/master/README.md)

> Flight Rules are the hard-earned body of knowledge recorded in manuals that list, step-by-step, what to do if X occurs, and why. Essentially, they are extremely detailed, scenario-specific standard operating procedures.

This repository is a simple list of sticky situations that you might find yourself in and how to fix them.

### Oh shit, git!

[Read Now &raquo;](http://ohshitgit.com/)

> Git is hard: screwing up is easy, and figuring out how to fix your mistakes is fucking impossible. Git documentation has this chicken and egg problem where you can't search for how to get yourself out of a mess, unless you already know the name of the thing you need to know about in order to fix your problem.
