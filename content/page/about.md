## Purpose

Everybody learns differently. Some people prefer reading books, and others prefer watching videos. For myself (and I'm sure that I'm not alone), it depends on my mood. This site is a curated list of resources for learning front-end web development.

## Who Am I?

My name is [Adam Giese](https://adamgiese.github.io/). I am a Web Developer who loves to learn. Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AdamGieseDev) or on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/AdamGiese/).

## Giving Suggestions

This site is completely available on [Github](https://github.com/adamgiese/learningfrontend). If you have a suggestion for a feature or resource, you can [create a new issue](https://github.com/adamgiese/learningfrontend/issues).
